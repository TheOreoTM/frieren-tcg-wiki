The first update of the game has been released. It includes a lot of balance changes and new characters.

---

## New characters

This patch brings two new characters to the game.

-   **Himmel**:

    -   Himmel's kit is based around his allies, Frieren, Heiter and Eisen. The more of his allies are active, the more damage the entire party deals.
    -   He's also very fast.
    -   Check out his [character page](/characters/himmel) for more information.

-   **Denken**:
    -   Denken's kit is based around multi-turn attacks, and a bunch of ways to throw hands
    -   He also never has it in him to give up. Denken will only lose if his HP is <= 0 for 3 consecutive turns
    -   Check out his [character page](/characters/denken) for more information.
