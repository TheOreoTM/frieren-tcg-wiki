The SECOND update of the game has been released. It includes **a lot** of balance changes and two new characters - **Fern** and **Übel**!

---

## New characters

This patch brings two new characters to the game.

-   **Fern**:

    -   Fern's kit is based around her oppressive multi-hit barrage, giving the opponent no window of reprieve.
    -   Fern also has the ability to focus all of her barrage's power into a strong single-hit piercing Concentrated Zoltraak Snipe, to break through characters with high bulk.
    -   Check out her [character page](/characters/fern) for more information!

-   **Übel**:
    -   Übel's a prototypical glass cannon. She is very fail, but her kit is based around her very hard-hitting, DEF-ignoring attacks, which all have a chance to fail.
    -   Übel's slashing attacks are sure to hit if the opponent attacked Übel before her attack however. Be careful engaging in reckless combat with Übel, or she can take you down very quickly!
    -   Check out her [character page](/characters/ubel) for more information!
